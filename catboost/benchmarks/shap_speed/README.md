# [SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874) values comparison

**Introduction**

In this benchmark we evaluated the shap values calculation performance for different gradient boosting libraries. The original paper about shap values you could find [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03888) and the official implementation [here](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).
	
Let us briefly overview the asymptotic analysis for different libraries.
	
Catboost:

where the AverageFeatureCount is an average number of features over all trees which could be found in a tree.

XGBoost and LightGBM:

As we're interested on the large scale datasets the most important values there are TreesCount and DocsCount. The factor of TreesCount * DocsCount in Catboost (TreeDepth + AverageFeaturesCount) is much smaller than in other libraries (LeavesCount * TreeDepth^2) such as XGBoost and LightGBM. So the larger the dataset is, the larger performance gain is achieved with Catboost.

**Experiment infrastructure**: 

* GPU: Titan X Pascal (used only for training)
* Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v3 @ 2.00GHz 
	
We trained models on GPU but all evaluations were done on CPU.

**Parameters**

We run experiments on different depths and test sizes for each 	library. ``max bin`` parameter was set up to 128 and 	other parameters were default for every library.
	
**Dataset**

We used [Epsilon dataset](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html) (400Ðš samples | 2000 features) to benchmark our performance.
	
		
**Results**

Time in the table is given in seconds and we didn't take into account time for data preprocessing.

Also we compared time for data preprocessing for every test size (average time is given in seconds for 5 runs).
